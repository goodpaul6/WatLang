Features:
- Structs

Flaws:
- We allow assiging *void to any type of pointer, but maybe the pointer count should match up 
(i.e. *void should only work with *something, not **something)
- We also allow passing any pointer to be passed into a *void arg but that's a little weird
doesn't really line up with assignment.
